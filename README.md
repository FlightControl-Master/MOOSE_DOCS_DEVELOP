# 1. MOOSE Framework

MOOSE is a **M**ission **O**bject **O**riented **S**cripting **E**nvironment, and is meant for mission designers and mission hosters.
It allows to quickly setup complex missions using pre-scripted scenarios using the available classes within the MOOSE Framework.
MOOSE works with DCS world 2.5 and earlier versions.

## [Donation ...](https://donorbox.org/fund-github-subscriptionfor-moose)

If you appreciate this development, please support to extend the framework. The development of this framework takes a lot of time.
A small gift would help me fund the costs and time that comes with it, to extend this framework while commuting to and from work ...
Also, your donations will be saved and spent wisely to the advantage of the community!

If everyone helps with a small amount, it would be really great!

# 2. **[MOOSE Usage Guide](Moose_Usage_Guide.html)**

You need to write lua code (scripts) to apply the MOOSE framework. 
But it is not really that hard, if you understand a couple of principles.

# 3. MOOSE Setup

The delivery of MOOSE follows a structured release process. Over time, new features are added that can be used in your mission.

### The latest release of MOOSE can be downloaded **[here](https://github.com/FlightControl-Master/MOOSE/releases)**.  

There are 3 different ways how you can use MOOSE, each with a different engagement and complexity level:


## 3.1. Setup the MOOSE Framework to use as a **Mission Designer**

Refer to the detailed **[MOOSE Setup Guide](Moose_Setup_Guide.html)** for more information.


## 3.2. Beta test MOOSE

Beta testers of MOOSE are requested to install additional software. 

As a return or as a reward, testers get:
 
  * Newly developed features planned for the next MOOSE release can be tested and incorporated in your missions early.
  * You can evaluate and contribute to the stability of the next release.
  * Your mission creation workflow becomes very flexible. New features are dynamically added to you missions.

Please read the detailed **[Beta Test Guide](Beta_Test_Guide.html)** for more information.
  
  
## 3.3. Contribute on the MOOSE development

Those people who have experience in lua development or are excited to contribute to the MOOSE project are welcome.

Please consult the **[Contribution Guide](Contribution_Guide.html)** for more information.
  

## 3.4. Debug your code interactively using LDT

Have a look at the **[Interactive Debug Guide](Interactive_Debug_Guide.html)** to setup your system so you can debug your mission code.



# 4. MOOSE Support Channels

MOOSE is broadcasted, documented and supported through various social media channels.  

Click here for the **[communities guide](Communities.html)** of the MOOSE framework.

# 5. MOOSE framework goal

The goal of MOOSE is to allow mission designers to **enhance the mission designs** by using **mission orchestration objects**, 
which can be _instantiated_ from defined classes within the framework. 
This will allow to write exciting missions and multi player cooperative operation scenarios. 

Of course, the richness of the framework will determine the richness of the misson scenarios. 
The MOOSE is a service that is produced while being consumed ... , 
it will evolve further as more classes are developed for the framework, and as more users are using it.  

MOOSE is NOT meant to be a one-man show, it is meant to evolve within a growing community around the framework.  

Within the community, key users will support, document, explain and even create new classes for the framework.
It is the ambition to grow this framework as a de-facto standard for mission designers to use within the DCS World community.


Thank you!
